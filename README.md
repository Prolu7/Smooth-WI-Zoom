# WI Zoom (Wurst-Imperium Zoom)

The zoom from the [Wurst Client](https://www.wurstclient.net/) as a standalone mod. The WI Zoom Minecraft mod lets you zoom in and out with the mouse wheel, providing up to 50x magnification without the need for a spyglass. This mod is fully compatible with OptiFine and Sodium, but unlike OptiFine's zoom, WI Zoom lets the camera move in a logical way, without making it wobble around. WI Zoom supports all of the latest Minecraft versions, including snapshots.

## Will you add Forge support?

Aside from the 1.12.2 Forge version that already exists, no. A modern Forge version is not being considered due to <a href="https://forums.minecraftforge.net/topic/58706-regarding-minecraft-112-and-policy-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Forge's new CoreMod policy</a> (effective since 1.13) as well as issues with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201125032822/https://gist.github.com/jellysquid3/629eb84a74ab326046faf971150dc6c3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Forge community's treatment of modders</a>.

However, the experimental&nbsp;<a href="https://patchworkmc.net/">Patchwork</a> project can sometimes make Forge mods and Fabric mods work together. Depending on which other mods you use, this might work with WI Zoom.

Also, keep in mind that many former Forge mods now have Fabric versions (or have switched to Fabric entirely due to the above-mentioned issues).
